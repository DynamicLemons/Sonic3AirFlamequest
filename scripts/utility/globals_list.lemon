// Utility

global u8 IsLosingRings  // Slowly losing rings, used in LBZ2 when the smog gets too thick and HCZ when the boiling water drains your rings.

// Hyper Ring
global u8 FlameQuest.hyperRingActive // Determines if the player currently has a Hyper Ring or not.

// Spilled Hyper Ring variables
// The vanilla scripts say that spilled_rings.speed is used as the speed for
// spilled rings, but none of the Hyper Ring replacements I've done seemed
// to directly affect speed. Maybe it's based on something else?
global u8 FlameQuest.hyperRingSpeed // Used as (speed &) timer for Hyper Rings (like spilled_rings.speed)

global u8 FlameQuest.hyperRingAnimFrame // Used like spilled_rings.animframe

global u16 FlameQuest.hyperRingProgress // Used like spilled_rings.progress in vanilla script


// For now, put defines here
define u8 FlameQuest.Monitor.HYPER_RING = 0x36 // Hyper Ring monitor define

// Stage

global u8 LBZSmogValue // Capped at 255
